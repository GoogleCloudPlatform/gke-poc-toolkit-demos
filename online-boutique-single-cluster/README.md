# ðŸš² GKE Poc Toolkit Demo: Online Boutique (Single Cluster)

This is a simple, 1-cluster demo of the GKE Poc Toolkit using the [Online Boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) (microservices-demo) sample app. 

## How to run 

1. **Go through the [GKE PoC Toolkit quickstart](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gke-poc-toolkit#quickstart) up until the `gkekitctl create` step.** 

2. **Export your project ID var.** 

```
export PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
```
3. **Edit `config.yaml` in this directory to replace `my-project` with your toolkit `PROJECT_ID`.** 

4. **Copy `config.yaml` to wherever you're running the toolkit from.**

5. **Run `gkekitctl create --config config.yaml` from this directory.** This will take about 10 minutes to run.

6. **Connect to your newly-created GKE cluster.** 

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials gke-central --region us-central1 --project $PROJECT_ID
```

Verify that you can access your cluster: 

```
kubectl get nodes
```

*Expected output*: 
```bash
NAME                                                  STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
gke-gke-central-linux-gke-toolkit-poo-12b0fa78-grhw   Ready    <none>   11m   v1.21.6-gke.1500
gke-gke-central-linux-gke-toolkit-poo-24d712a2-jm5g   Ready    <none>   11m   v1.21.6-gke.1500
gke-gke-central-linux-gke-toolkit-poo-6fb11d07-h6xb   Ready    <none>   11m   v1.21.6-gke.1500
```

7. **Clone your Anthos Config Management (ACM) sync repo.** 

```
gcloud source repos clone gke-poc-config-sync --project=$PROJECT_ID
cd gke-poc-config-sync
```

8. **Download the latest Online Boutique release manifests into your ACM repo, then push to `main` branch.** This will effectively deploy the sample app to your GKE cluster.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/main/release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml --no-check-certificate
git checkout -b main
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Online Boutique" 
git push origin main
```

*Expected output*:

9. **Watch for the Online Boutique Deployments and Services to be created via Config Sync.** 

```bash 
watch kubectl get pods
```

*Expected output*:

```

10. **View the Online Boutique frontend in a browser to verify successful deployment.** 

```bash 
kubectl get svc frontend-external
```

*Expected output*: 

```
NAME                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
frontend-external   LoadBalancer   10.1.142.8   <your-external-ip>   80:30499/TCP   3m4s
```

Use the `EXTERNAL_IP` to access the Online Boutique frontend.

# Explore the demo

If you're walking someone else through this demo, or using this to learn about GKE, here are some things you can look at.

## GKE Cluster 

[Link](https://console.google.com/kubernetes/list)

You can click on the cluster name to view its details: cluster's region, what VPC network it's on, security features like [Shielded Nodes](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/shielded-gke-nodes) and [Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/workload-identity) are enabled. 

You can go to the Nodes tab to see the cluster's [Node Pools](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/node-pools): how many nodes per pool, what operating system your nodes use. 

![node pools](screenshots/node-pool-details.png)

## Config Sync 

[Link](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/config_management)

[Config Sync](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/config-sync-overview) is installed on your GKE cluster during `create`. 

If you click on your cluster's name, an info panel appears to the right, showing your cluster's sync status (+ any errors), and the install settings for ACM (eg. [Policy Controller](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/policy-controller) enabled, what repo Config Sync is syncing from, what branch.)

![config sync](screenshots/config-management-status.png)

## GKE Workloads 

[Link](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/workload)

The app you just deployed is called [Online Boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo). It's a sample retail web application for an online store. There are 11 microservices that make up this application. All services - including the Redis database - run inside your GKE cluster.  

![arch](screenshots/online-boutique-arch.png)

You can show how the Online Boutique app maps to specific Kubernetes objects. 
For instance, the Workloads tab shows you the app's Deployments (you can filter on `namespace:default` to filter out system / ACM workloads.) If you click on one Deployment, for instance "cartservice," you can see how the Deployment spawns Pods, running the containerized service. 

![cartservice](screenshots/cartservice-pod.png)


And back in the deployment, you can see how cartservice also gets a Kubernetes service, allowing all backing pods to be reachable within the cluster. (ie. so that the frontend can add things to the user's cart.)

## Containers

To go a step further, you can see how cartservice + others are packaged up so that they can run as containers inside GKE. 

To do this, open the [cartservice's source code directory](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/main/src/cartservice/src), and click on [Dockerfile](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/blob/main/src/cartservice/src/Dockerfile). You'll see something like this: 

```Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0.102 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY cartservice.csproj .
RUN dotnet restore cartservice.csproj -r linux-musl-x64
COPY . .
RUN dotnet publish cartservice.csproj -p:PublishSingleFile=true -r linux-musl-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishTrimmed=True -p:TrimMode=Link -c release -o /cartservice --no-restore

# https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/dotnet/runtime-deps/tags/list
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:6.0.2-alpine3.14-amd64
RUN GRPC_HEALTH_PROBE_VERSION=v0.4.6 && \
    wget -qO/bin/grpc_health_probe https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-health-probe/releases/download/${GRPC_HEALTH_PROBE_VERSION}/grpc_health_probe-linux-amd64 && \
    chmod +x /bin/grpc_health_probe
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /cartservice .
ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS http://*:7070
ENTRYPOINT ["/app/cartservice"]
```

A [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#:~:text=A%20Dockerfile%20is%20a%20text,can%20use%20in%20a%20Dockerfile%20.) tells a container builder (eg. `docker` CLI) how to build the source code into a container. The Online Boutique team has CI that automatically builds this container using the Dockerfile, and pushes it to Google Container Registry [here](https://gcr.io/google-samples/microservices-demo/cartservice). That "release" container image [is what you just deployed to GKE](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/blob/main/release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml#L435); you didn't have to build this on your own. 

## gRPC 

Online Boutique's backend services use [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) as their transport protocol, whereas the frontend uses regular HTTP. If your audience is interesting in seeing how gRPC works, you can... 

- Show a proto file - eg. [cartservice](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/blob/main/pb/demo.proto#L21). This is the gRPC service spec used to generate the client and server code in cartservice's target language, C#.  

- Show a gRPC client. The frontend talks to cartservice [like this](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/blob/main/src/frontend/handlers.go#L225). 

- Show a gRPC server. [Here's how the cartservice serves requests.](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/blob/main/src/cartservice/src/services/CartService.cs#L34)


## Logging

[Observability](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-measurement-monitoring-and-observability) is an important part of running any application in the cloud. GKE makes observability easy by exporting your container's application logs and basic metrics to Google Cloud Operations.

[Link](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query)

View the application logs across all Online Boutique services by running this query: 

```
resource.type="k8s_container" resource.labels.cluster_name="gke-central" resource.labels.namespace_name="default"
```

![logs](screenshots/logs.png)

## Monitoring 

[Link](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/metrics-explorer)

[GKE sends System metrics](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/gke/managing-metrics) to Google Cloud Monitoring, including pod CPU and memory usage. ([Full list](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_kubernetes)). 

For instance, you can view GKE pod memory usage across all Online Boutique services, by opening the Metrics Explorer (link above), going to the MQL tab, and running this query:

```
fetch k8s_container
| metric 'kubernetes.io/container/memory/used_bytes'
| filter
    (resource.cluster_name == 'gke-central'
     && resource.namespace_name == 'default')
| group_by 1m, [value_used_bytes_mean: mean(value.used_bytes)]
| every 1m
| group_by [metadata.user.app: metadata.user_labels.app],
    [value_used_bytes_mean_aggregate: aggregate(value_used_bytes_mean)]
```

You should see something like this:
